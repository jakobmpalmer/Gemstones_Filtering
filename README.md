# ðŸ’ŽGemstones FilteringðŸ’Ž
This problem uses multiple processes and a stored file of information to address two questions about gemstones. Given a color, select all gemstones of the given color, and print them in alphabetical order by gemstone name. Also, print all gemstones whose hardness and specific gravity values are within specified ranges.

Instructions for compilation
Prepare your favorite C compiler. This will be gcc for Linux/OSX, or a third party program for Windows. I chose to use [Mingw](http://www.mingw.org/).
