This problem uses multiple processes and a stored file of information to address two questions about gemstones. Given a color, select all gemstones of the given color, and print them in alphabetical order by gemstone name. Also, print all gemstones whose hardness and specific gravity values are within specified ranges.

### Instructions for Running and Compilation
Prepare your favorite C compiler. This will be gcc for Linux/OSX, or a third party program for Windows. I chose to use [Mingw](http://www.mingw.org/).

Use the -v flag to check your gcc version.

```bash
gcc -v
```

Once you confirm you have your compiler setup you can compile the C code like so.

```bash
gcc your_file_name.c -o your_program_name
```

The -o flag is used to specify your output file name. This will be the file we use to execute the program. 

On Linux, given you are in the same directory as your output file, we can use the following command to run our file.

```bash
./your_program_name
```

And on Windows we can simply use our filename.

```bash
your_program_name
```
